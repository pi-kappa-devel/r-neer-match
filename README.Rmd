The package `neermatch` provides a set of tools for neural-symbolic entity reasoning and matching. It is designed to support easy set-up, training, and inference of entity matching models using deep learning, symbolic learning, and a hybrid approach combining both deep and symbolic learning. Moreover, the package provides automated fuzzy logic reasoning (by refutation) functionality that can be used to examine the significance of particular associations between fields in an entity matching task.

The project is financially supported by the [Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft](https://www.dfg.de/de) (DFG) under Grant 539465691 as part of the Infrastructure Priority Programme "[New Data Spaces for the Social Sciences](https://www.new-data-spaces.de/en-us/)" (SPP 2431). 

## Features
The package is built on the concept of similarity maps. Similarity maps are concise representations of potential associations between fields in two datasets. Entities from two datasets can be matched using one or more pairs of fields (one from each dataset). Each field pair can have one or more ways to compute the similarity between the values of the fields.

Similarity maps are used to automate the construction of entity matching models and to facilitate the reasoning capabilities of the package. More details on the concept of similarity maps and an early implementation of the package's functionality (without neural-symbolic components) are given by [@karapanagiotis2023].

The training loops for both deep and symbolic learning models are implemented in [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) [see @tensorflow2015]. The pure deep learning model inherits from the [keras](https://keras.io) model class [@keras2015]. The neural-symbolic model is implemented using the logic tensor network ([LTN](https://pypi.org/project/ltn/)) framework [@badreddine2022logic]. Pure neural-symbolic and hybrid models do not inherit directly from the [@keras2015] model class, but they emulate the behavior by providing custom `compile`, `fit`, `evaluate`, and `predict`methods, so that all model classes in `neermatch` have a uniform calling interface.

# Basic Usage

Implementing matching models using `neermatch` is a three-step process: 

1. Instantiate a model with a similarity map.
2. Compile the model.
3. Train the model.

To train the model you need to provide three datasets. Two datasets should contain records representing the entities to be matched. By convention, the first dataset is called Left and the second dataset is called Right dataset in the package's documentation. The third dataset should contain the ground truth labels for the matching entities. The ground truth dataset should have two columns, one for the index of the entity in the Left dataset and one for the index of the entity in the Right dataset.

```{r example}
# see also vignette("fuzzy-games") for a more detailed example
library(neermatch)

# 0) replace this with your own data preprocessing function
matching_data <- fuzzy_games_example_data()

# 1) customize according to the fields in your data
similarity_map <- SimilarityMap(
  list(
    title = list("jaro", "levenshtein"),
    `developer~dev` = list("jaro_winkler"),
    year = list("gaussian")
  )
)
model <- NSMatchingModel(similarity_map)

# 2) compile
compile(model)

# 3) train
fit(
  model,
  matching_data$left, matching_data$right, matching_data$matches,
  epochs = 1L, batch_size = 16L
)
```

# Installation

## From Source

You can obtain the sources for the development version of `neermatch` from its github [repository](https://github.com/pi-kappa-devel/r-neer-match).

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/pi-kappa-devel/r-neer-match
```

The installation package can be built using:

``` bash
R CMD build r-neer-match
```

The last command produces a file named `neermatch_<version>.tar.gz`, where `<version>` is the latest version number of the package. This can be used to install the package in R as follows:

``` bash
R CMD INSTALL neermatch_<version>.tar.gz
```

# Documentation

Online documentation is available for the [release](https://r-neer-match.pikappa.eu) and [in-development](https://r-neer-match.pikappa.eu/dev/) versions of the package.

## Reproducing Documentation from Source

The README.md file can be created using [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
